There and back again, a developer's tale
========================================

- Introduction
	- The state of JS...
		- JS apps
		- Google Play
		- Google Docs
		- arts.ucla.edu
	- ...and WordPress
		- ustwo.com
		- qz.com
- Section one: The problem, using websites often sucks...
	- Connections can be crappy, more often than we would like despite innovations
	- Page load times can be slow
	- Difficult to smoothly animate (like an app)
	- Difficult to create continuous experiences
	- Without using JavaScript, it's going to get harder
		- Service Worker
		- Push notifications
- Section two: Single-page applications
	- Have historically been well criticised
	- Example such as ****
	- Have been maturing over a long period of time
	- Not necessarily suited to every use case, but far more than we use them for at the moment
	- The downsides/challenges are historically summarised as:
		- Search engine optimisation
		- Client/server code partitioning
		- Browser history
		- Analytics
		- Speed of initial load
	- Wikipedia article outlines above, but also talks about solutions. Yes, you can find answers to these problems on Wikipedia!
	- Much of the development around browsers and HTML specifically targets making these things better
- Section three: Marrying WordPress and single-page applications
	- So, we currently don't have these problems with WordPress.
	- In fact, the fact that WordPress deals with these things well is one of its key strengths.
	- We don't want to introduce lots of new problems. We want to have our cake and eat it (or at least I do).

		- History API
	- Client/server code partitioning
